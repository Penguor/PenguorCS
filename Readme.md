# PenguorCS

This repository contains the source code of the PenguorCS compiler for the Penguor language.

## Overview

Penguor is an in-development data-oriented language. Currently, it is in a very early stage and it does not have many features yet. The ultimate goal is to create a fast, feature-rich language optimized for games and other applications which need to handle lots of data.
