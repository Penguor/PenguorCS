# PenguorCS

This repository contains the source code of the PenguorCS compiler for the Penguor language.

## Overview

Penguor is an in-development data-oriented language. Currently, it is in a `very` early stage and it does not have many features yet. The ultimate goal is to create a fast, feature-rich language optimized for games and other applications which need to handle lots of data.

Work-in-progress documentation can soon be found [here](https://penguor.readthedocs.io/).

## Example

The following code will show a "Hello World" program written in Penguor:

```
public system Hello
{
    void execute()
    {
        print("Hello World")
    }
}
```
