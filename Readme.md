This repository contains the source code of the PenguorCS compiler for the Penguor language.

## Overview

Penguor is an in-development data-oriented language. Currently, it is in a very early stage and it does not have many features yet. The ultimate goal is to create a fast, feature-rich language optimized for games and other applications which need to handle lots of data.

Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Penguor/PenguorDocs)

## Roadmap

- finish assembly generation
- optimize compiler
- rework penguor grammar to be more data-oriented (currently it is strongly inspired by C#, Java and similar languages.)
